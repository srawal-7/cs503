## Assignment 2 Questions

1. In this assignment I asked you provide an implementation for the `get_student(...)` function because I think it improves the overall design of the database application. After you implemented your solution do you agree that externalizing `get_student(...)` into it's own function is a good design strategy?  Briefly describe why or why not.

    > **Answer**:  I agree that externalizing get_student(...) is a good design strategy for reusability. By separating the logic for retrieving a student's information, it becomes more efficient to call the get_student() function rather than writing the same code multiple times. Furthermore, if changes need to be made to the way student records are retrieved, modifying the get_student() function once will apply the change throughout the codebase. This approach makes the code more efficient, maintainable, and easier to follow.

2. Another interesting aspect of the `get_student(...)` function is how its function prototype requires the caller to provide the storage for the `student_t` structure:

    ```c
    int get_student(int fd, int id, student_t *s);
    ```

    Notice that the last parameter is a pointer to storage **provided by the caller** to be used by this function to populate information about the desired student that is queried from the database file. This is a common convention (called pass-by-reference) in the `C` programming language. 

    In other programming languages an approach like the one shown below would be more idiomatic for creating a function like `get_student()` (specifically the storage is provided by the `get_student(...)` function itself):

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t student;
        bool student_found = false;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found)
            return &student;
        else
            return NULL;
    }
    ```
    Can you think of any reason why the above implementation would be a **very bad idea** using the C programming language?  Specifically, address why the above code introduces a subtle bug that could be hard to identify at runtime? 

    > **ANSWER:** The problem with the above implementation is that it returns a pointer to a local variable, 
    'student', which is stored on the stack (meaning it is temporary). When the function ends, the memory for that local variable is no longer valid, meaning the pointer is pointing to a location that doesn’t exist anymore. If we try to access that memory, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. The original approach avoids this by giving the caller control over the memory, ensuring that it remains valid for as long as needed.

3. Another way the `get_student(...)` function could be implemented is as follows:

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND or memory allocation error: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t *pstudent;
        bool student_found = false;

        pstudent = malloc(sizeof(student_t));
        if (pstudent == NULL)
            return NULL;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found){
            return pstudent;
        }
        else {
            free(pstudent);
            return NULL;
        }
    }
    ```
    In this implementation the storage for the student record is allocated on the heap using `malloc()` and passed back to the caller when the function returns. What do you think about this alternative implementation of `get_student(...)`?  Address in your answer why it work work, but also think about any potential problems it could cause.  
    
    > **ANSWER:** This alternative implementation of get_student works by allocating memory on the heap with malloc(), allowing the student data to persist after the function finishes. However, it introduces a risk of memory leaks if the caller forgets to free() the allocated memory. This can lead to performance issues or crashes over time. Additionally, dynamic memory allocation adds overhead, which may be unnecessary if the caller provides the storage directly.


4. Lets take a look at how storage is managed for our simple database. Recall that all student records are stored on disk using the layout of the `student_t` structure (which has a size of 64 bytes).  Lets start with a fresh database by deleting the `student.db` file using the command `rm ./student.db`.  Now that we have an empty database lets add a few students and see what is happening under the covers.  Consider the following sequence of commands:

    ```bash
    > ./sdbsc -a 1 john doe 345
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 128 Jan 17 10:01 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 3 jane doe 390
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 256 Jan 17 10:02 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 63 jim doe 285 
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 64 janet doe 310
    > du -h ./student.db
        8.0K    ./student.db
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 4160 Jan 17 10:03 ./student.db
    ```

    For this question I am asking you to perform some online research to investigate why there is a difference between the size of the file reported by the `ls` command and the actual storage used on the disk reported by the `du` command.  Understanding why this happens by design is important since all good systems programmers need to understand things like how linux creates sparse files, and how linux physically stores data on disk using fixed block sizes.  Some good google searches to get you started: _"lseek syscall holes and sparse files"_, and _"linux file system blocks"_.  After you do some research please answer the following:

    - Please explain why the file size reported by the `ls` command was 128 bytes after adding student with ID=1, 256 after adding student with ID=3, and 4160 after adding the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** The difference in file size reported by ls and du is due to sparse files in Linux. Sparse files allocate space for blocks but don't use physical storage for unused sections, which results in a smaller actual disk usage (du). For example, after adding a student, the file size increases in ls, but no actual data is written in the "empty" space, so du reports minimal disk usage. As more records are added, the file size grows, but disk space is allocated in fixed-size blocks, causing the file size to appear larger in ls than it actually is on disk.

    -   Why did the total storage used on the disk remain unchanged when we added the student with ID=1, ID=3, and ID=63, but increased from 4K to 8K when we added the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** The disk storage remained unchanged when adding students with IDs 1, 3, and 63 because the file was sparse and didn’t use more disk space. When adding student ID=64, a new block was required, increasing the disk usage from 4K to 8K. This happens because the file system allocates storage in fixed-size blocks, and adding records fills up the sparse file.

    - Now lets add one more student with a large student ID number  and see what happens:

        ```bash
        > ./sdbsc -a 99999 big dude 205 
        > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 6400000 Jan 17 10:28 ./student.db
        > du -h ./student.db
        12K     ./student.db
        ```
        We see from above adding a student with a very large student ID (ID=99999) increased the file size to 6400000 as shown by `ls` but the raw storage only increased to 12K as reported by `du`.  Can provide some insight into why this happened?

        > **ANSWER:** When adding a student with ID=99999, the file size grew significantly according to ls -l, but disk usage only increased slightly as reported by du -h. This is due to the use of sparse files in Linux, where the file's logical size includes unused space, but the actual disk space is only allocated for the regions containing data. The large file size reflects the potential space needed for student IDs up to 99999, but the disk usage remains small since the gaps between records are not physically stored.
